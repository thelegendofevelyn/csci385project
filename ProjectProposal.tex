\maketitle

As the assignment itself says, I am very much not committed to setting this idea in stone, but the main idea is as follows: I have noticed that library websites are not particularly efficient, and while our school's library website has recently had a slight overhaul, the catalog is somewhat difficult to navigate. The main problem is partially in how the items are stored in the system, and partially in how the site throws so much information on a single page and then expects the user to try to navigate it. To hopefully mitigate the problem, I have a paper I've been reading (The Role of the Library Web Site - https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/44699/DiazK_Ref_User_Ser_Qtrly_v.38_no.1_1998_p41-43.pdf?sequence=1) to come up with a better idea of what I want the site to look like, but in general, I already know that it needs to be more minimalistic. The main thing I would like to do would be to design a better site, although I have a vague notion that I could definitely incorporate threading into this in order to make the site handle processes separately.
